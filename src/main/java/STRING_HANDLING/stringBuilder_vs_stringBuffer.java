    /* Difference between string buffer and string builder is,

    1. String buffer is thread safe, i:e synchronized, whereas String builder is not thread safe i:e not synchronized.

    2. String buffer(performance is moderate) is slow due to synchronization and String builder(performance is very high) is fast.

    3. String buffer storage area is in the heap and string builder storage area is the stack.

    4. String buffer consumes more memory and String builder consumes less memory.
