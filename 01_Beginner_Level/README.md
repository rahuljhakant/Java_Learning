## 🎯 Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- No prior programming experience required
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher installed
- A text editor or IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   ```bash
   # Check if Java is installed
   java -version
   javac -version
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   - Choose an IDE or text editor
   - Configure Java path if needed

3. **Start with Introduction to Java**
   - Read `JavaOverview.java` to understand Java concepts
   - Run `HelloWorld.java` to write your first program

4. **Follow the tutorial sequence**
   - Complete each section in order
   - Practice with the provided examples
   - Try modifying the code to experiment

## 📝 Practice Exercises

### Beginner Exercises
1. **Calculator Program**: Create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations
2. **Student Grade Calculator**: Calculate and display student grades based on marks
3. **Number Guessing Game**: Create a game where users guess a random number
4. **Simple Banking System**: Create a basic bank account with deposit/withdraw functionality

### Code Challenges
1. **Pattern Printing**: Print various patterns using loops
2. **Prime Number Checker**: Check if a number is prime
3. **Fibonacci Series**: Generate Fibonacci numbers
4. **String Manipulation**: Reverse strings, check palindromes

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

### Compilation Errors
- **"javac is not recognized"**: Add JDK bin directory to PATH
- **"class not found"**: Check package declarations and file structure
- **"syntax error"**: Verify semicolons, braces, and parentheses

### Runtime Errors
- **"NoClassDefFoundError"**: Ensure classpath is set correctly
- **"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException"**: Check array bounds in loops
- **"NullPointerException"**: Initialize objects before using them

### Best Practices
- Always use meaningful variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Test your code frequently
